Initially, I wanted to make a personal website around a month ago, but I didn't have much time to get into it because of school related work (even though I have 12 units this term), and my general laziness. I only got the time during my week long break due to the holidays followed by the non-working holiday announcements. Anyways, this website is done using Jekyll, a *powerful* static site generator. My experience in using Jekyll was alright, I didn't find it difficult to understand YAML front matter and after playing around with it for a while, I started writing my index page. I used SCSS to style my site and the design idea was to display information in a simple, minimalistic and responsive way.

This project is done so I'll be able to have a place to display my personal projects (and also some of my academic ones too), and write some occasional blog entries about anything interesting that has happened in my life. Future plans I'd like to implement for this site is to have some sort of analytics to keep track of web traffic, and add other functionalities as well.

Currently I'm in the middle of doing my coursework for my classes, and I plan on working on my personal projects soon, during the term break, *hopefully*.
