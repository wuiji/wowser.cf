Today was the first time I drank an espresso shot, in fact, I drank 2, and it got me palpitating *bad*.

I figured that I needed to update my blog from a month of inactivity, so to start it off, today marks the start of my term break! That means I can do whatever I want until the start of next term, right? Nope, I need to find work, for my internship. My window of opportunity to find one is until Christmas when every company/start up/organization closes down until next year, the same time next term will start. It's not really critical to find one before next year, I just don't want to start late. And if anything, it's my fault that I did not focus on finding an internship for the rest of the term.

Processing my thoughts for this term made me realize that I overestimate myself too much. Yeah I passed all my units, but I did not work as hard or did not spend enough time to focus on them, and I did not get the results that I wanted. A good example would be this blog, I told myself that I would at least try to maintain it, but there was no activity or changes made into this project for the last month. I want to say my excuse is that I have a lot on my plate, with deadlines for school, extra curricular activities, and job finding, but I could have at least put out some blog entries to not make it look dead, well, until now I guess.

Enough with the sad niðŸ…±ðŸ…±a hours.

My favorite part at the start of the term break is to organize my school related files and dump them into an archive folder. The way I to do it is I just run the command `move /-y *.* "C:\Users\luigi\Documents\DLSU\Year 3\Term 1"`, since all my files are dumped and sorted into the Downloads foler, I just simply copy paste everything to an archive folder. Oh and the destination directory should already be existing. I hope there's a way to do that in real life, especially the crap in my room.

A quick peek about my hobbies,
I just got caught up with [Grand Blue][grand-blue] and damn what a read, powerful comedy, unique charcters, and the story has been consistent so far. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.

Anyways, I need to do something productive this term break, by first securing an internship.
